# Oracle instaclient files

These files contain the Oracle instaclient libraries for OSX and Linux that are required to build the
Oracle driver for SilkJS.

If you use them, you must agree to the terms of their OTN License which can be found here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/instant-client-lic-152016.html

It's not clear to me if I can include these files in this repository.  My intent is to keep them here so 
I can use the repo to share the files between my different systems at work and home.
